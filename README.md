#  Real-Time Monitoring System on Sucker Rod Pump (SRP)

##  Overview
This project focuses on the **real-time monitoring and performance analysis** of **Sucker Rod Pumps (SRP)** using data from the **ONGC Mehsana Asset**. The goal was to study how **Real-Time Monitoring Systems (RTMS)** can be applied to enhance the operational efficiency and reliability of artificial lift systems in oil production.

##  Objectives
- To understand the **working principles and components** of Real-Time Monitoring Systems (RTMS).  
- To analyze **dynamometer card data** for identifying pump performance issues.  
- To interpret **load vs. stroke graphs** to evaluate downhole pump behavior.  
- To explore how **automation and sensor data** can optimize production and reduce downtime.

##  Methodology
1. Collected real-time production data from **SRP-equipped wells** through the RTMS dashboard.  
2. Studied **dynamometer-generated graphs** to identify operational anomalies.  
3. Evaluated **load, displacement, and stroke efficiency curves** to assess pump performance.  
4. Analyzed patterns to detect **gas interference, pump-off conditions, and rod string failures**.  
5. Compiled insights into **predictive maintenance strategies** using real-time monitoring.
